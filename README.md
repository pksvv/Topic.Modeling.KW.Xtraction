Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique thatâ€™s capable of scanning a set of documents, detecting word and phrase patterns within them, and automatically clustering word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents.

Using following algos to implement topic modeling. All these involve linear algebra and dimensionality reduction to filter out the most relevant topic for a document.

* LDA - Latent Dirichlet Allocation
* LSA - Latent Semantic Analysis
* NMT - Non-Negative Matrix factorization
